The code is organized into 3 files; `client.rs`, `server.rs`, and `lib.rs`. Rust automagically generates binaries for client and server, lib simply has a small amount of shared code.

To run the server, run
```./server <IP> <PORT>```

For the client, run
```./client <MOBILE_ID> <IP> <SERVER_PORT> <CLIENT_PORT>```

Run as many of them as you want.
